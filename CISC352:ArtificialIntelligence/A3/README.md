### Project Name: Ghostbusters
### Project Description
The Ghostbusters project involves implementing inference algorithms for tracking invisible ghosts in a Pacman game. The game has a noisy distance sensor that provides inaccurate readings of the Manhattan distance to each ghost, and the goal is to implement belief updates and filtering to better estimate the ghosts' positions. The project involves implementing classes for Discrete Distributions, Busters Agents, and Ghost Agents, and includes tasks such as implementing sampling methods, normalizing distributions, and updating beliefs with new evidence.

### Skills Demonstrated
The Ghostbusters project requires a strong understanding of probability theory and inference algorithms, as well as proficiency in Python programming. Skills demonstrated in this project include implementing classes and methods for discrete distributions, working with game states and agents in a Pacman game, implementing filtering and belief updates, and debugging code with an autograder. Additionally, the project requires attention to detail and the ability to work with complex algorithms and data structures, as well as the ability to write effective and efficient code.
