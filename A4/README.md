### Project Name: Perceptron, Digit Classification, Building Neural Nets.

### Project Description: Machine learning and neural networks
The Perceptron question involves implementing nodes to compute the dot product of a weight vector and input to train a neural network for sin approximation. The Digit Classification project requires a neural network implementation for digit classification. The Building Neural Nets project involves implementing a neural network with linear operations and ReLU non-linearity for solving machine learning problems. The final question on a Neural Network mini library defines a collection of node objects and their operations, such as Add, AddBias, Linear, ReLU, and SoftmaxLoss, in a guide format.

### Skills Demonstrated
The projects showcase skills in machine learning and neural networks, including implementation of nodes, neural networks, and understanding of data sets, loss functions, and validation accuracy. The tutorial project demonstrates skills in optimizing node objects for faster operation.
